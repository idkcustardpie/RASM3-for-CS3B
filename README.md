Determine if str3 and str4 are equal and output result
Determine if str3 and str4 are equal !ignoring the case! and output result

Create str5 that is a copy of str1
Determine if str1 and str5 are equal and output result
Create str6 and is a substring of str1 that begins in position 1 and ends in position 5 and output result
Use str6 again to contain the address of a substring of str1 that begins just in position 1 and output result

**Input iPosition and test the
Display the single character at position 3 in str1 and post an appropriate message
**Input strTest and input iPosition (converted asci value). Determine if str1 starts with strTest starting inbiPosition and output result. Do this 2x testing your startsWith method so that it tests both true and false.

**Input strTest
Determine if str1 starts with strTest and post an appropriate message
**Input strTest
Determine if str1 ends with strTest and post an appropriate message
etc.
